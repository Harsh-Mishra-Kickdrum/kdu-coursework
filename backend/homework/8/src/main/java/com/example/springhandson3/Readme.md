## Implementation Details

- The project follows a standard MVC architecture with separate packages for controller, dto, entity, repository, and services.
- Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code in entity classes.
- CRUD operations are implemented in the VehicleRepository class using an in-memory ConcurrentHashMap.
- Service methods in VehicleService and VehicleServiceImpl provide business logic for the controller.

## Testing
- Postman can be used to test the various API endpoints mentioned above.
